# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This blog is built using **Next.js** and **MDX**.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import and use React components directly in your blog posts.

### Features

- **Next.js Routing**: Each post is a page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled with utility classes.
- **Framer Motion**: Subtle animations for better UX.

Stay tuned for more updates!
